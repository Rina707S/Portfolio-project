              Cosplay, a portmanteau of "costume play", is an activity and
              performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear
              costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific
              character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture, and a
              broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any costumed
              role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends
              itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject.
              Favorite sources include anime, cartoons, comic books, manga,
              television series, and video games. Cosplay grew out of the
              practice of fan costuming at science fiction conventions,
              beginning with Morojo's "futuristicostumes" created for the 1st
              World Science Fiction Convention held in New York City in 1939.
              The Japanese term "cosplay" („Ç≥„Çπ„Éó„É¨, kosupure) was coined in
              1984. A rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby
              since the 1990s has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of
              popular culture in Japan, as well as in other parts of East Asia
              and in the Western world. Cosplay events are common features of
              fan conventions, and today there are many dedicated conventions
              and competitions, as well as social networks, websites, and other
              forms of media centered on cosplay activities. Cosplay is very
              popular among all genders, and it is not unusual to see genders
              switched.
